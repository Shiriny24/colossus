***************************************************************************************************

You can install Colossus as a python package by executing one of the following commands, depending 
on your preferred installer software. You might need to prefix these commands with 'sudo'::

    pip install https://bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus/get/tip.tar.gz
    easy_install https://bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus/get/tip.tar.gz

Alternatively, you can clone the public BitBucket repository [https://bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus] 
by executing::

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus

For the latter method, you will need the version control system Mercurial (hg), which you can 
download [`here <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_].
