    "Instead of thinking of halos as objects with a particular mass, we can think of them as statistical fluctuations in the Gaussian random field that seeded cosmic structure. In this picture, the mass of a halo can be expressed as a significance or \"peak height\". In a Gaussian random field, peak height is trivially defined as overdensity, delta, divided by the variance. Halos, however, are non-linearly collapsed objects; what is their overdensity, and what is the corresponding variance?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the approximation of linear collapse to derive a definition. According to the top-hat collapse model (Gunn & Gott 1972), shells of dark matter turn around once they include a certain overdensity, and one can come up with a crude estimate for when they collapse into a \"virialized\" object. At this point in time, the overdensity enclosed is 1.686 (in an Einstein-de Sitter universe). To compute the variance, we assign the halo a spatial scale corresponding to the radius that enclosed the halo's mass initially, called the Lagrangian radius (which depends on our definition of the halo's mass today). \n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these two estimates, we obtain an expression for the peak height, nu = 1.686 / sigma(R, z). Objects with small peak heights have, on average, collapsed in the past. Objects with nu = 1 are collapsing at the current time, and objects with large peak heights have, on average, not yet collapsed. This logic leads to the concept of the non-linear mass scale, i.e., the mass that is currently collapsing which satisfies nu(M_NL) = 1.\n",
